# API Key Configuration

## Groq API Key Setup

The system has been configured with a Groq API key to enable AI-powered test generation from URLs.

### Configuration Details:
- ✅ `.env` file created with GROQ_API_KEY
- ✅ Grok service can access the API key
- ✅ System will use AI analysis instead of fallback mode

### Expected Behavior:
- **Before**: "⚠️ No API key available, using fallback test generation"
- **After**: Screenshots analyzed with Groq AI for intelligent test case generation

### API Key Used:
- **Provider**: Groq (X.AI)
- **Format**: gsk_K0Cq...NajEcGRW
- **Purpose**: Enable AI-powered URL analysis and test generation

### Verification:
The configuration has been tested and verified to work correctly. The system will now:
1. Take screenshots of target URLs
2. Analyze them with Groq AI instead of falling back
3. Generate more intelligent test cases based on actual page content
4. Clean up screenshots after successful analysis

### Files Modified:
- `.env` - Created with proper GROQ_API_KEY configuration

### Files Excluded from Git:
- `.env` - Contains sensitive API key, properly excluded via .gitignore
