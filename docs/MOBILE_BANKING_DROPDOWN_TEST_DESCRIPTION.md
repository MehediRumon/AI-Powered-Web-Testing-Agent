# Natural Language Test Description for Mobile Banking Type Dropdown

## HTML Element
```html
<select class="form-control valid" data-val="true" data-val-number="The field Mobile Banking Type must be a number." id="MobileBankingType" name="MobileBankingType">
    <option value="">Select Type</option>

```

## Natural Language Test Description

### Comprehensive Test Scenario
**"Navigate to the mobile banking form page, locate the Mobile Banking Type dropdown with ID 'MobileBankingType', select the 'Nagad' option (which has value '20'), and verify that the selection was successful by confirming the dropdown now shows 'Nagad' as the selected option."**

### Breaking Down the Test Actions

#### 1. Basic Selection Test
**"Select 'Nagad' from the Mobile Banking Type dropdown"**

This natural language description would generate the following test actions:

```json
{
  "type": "select",
  "locator": "#MobileBankingType",
  "value": "Nagad",
  "description": "Select Nagad from Mobile Banking Type dropdown"
}
```

#### 2. Selection by Value Test
**"Select option with value '20' from the Mobile Banking Type dropdown"**

This would generate:

```json
{
  "type": "select",
  "locator": "#MobileBankingType",
  "value": "20",
  "description": "Select option with value '20' from Mobile Banking Type dropdown"
}
```

#### 3. Verification Test
**"Verify that the Mobile Banking Type dropdown shows 'Nagad' as selected"**

This would generate:

```json
{
  "type": "assert_text",
  "locator": "#MobileBankingType option:selected",
  "value": "Nagad",
  "description": "Verify Nagad is selected in Mobile Banking Type dropdown"
}
```

### Multi-Step Test Scenarios

#### Complete Workflow Test
**"Navigate to the payment form, select 'Nagad' from the Mobile Banking Type dropdown, verify the selection is successful, and confirm that the dropdown value is '20' while the displayed text is 'Nagad'."**

This comprehensive description would generate multiple test actions:

```json
{
  "testCase": {
    "name": "Mobile Banking Type Selection Test",
    "description": "Test selecting Nagad option from Mobile Banking Type dropdown",
    "url": "https://example.com/payment-form",
    "actions": [
      {
        "type": "navigate",
        "locator": "",
        "value": "https://example.com/payment-form",
        "description": "Navigate to the payment form"
      },
      {
        "type": "select",
        "locator": "#MobileBankingType",
        "value": "Nagad",
        "description": "Select Nagad from Mobile Banking Type dropdown"
      },
      {
        "type": "assert_visible",
        "locator": "#MobileBankingType",
        "description": "Verify Mobile Banking Type dropdown is visible"
      },
      {
        "type": "assert_text",
        "locator": "#MobileBankingType option:selected",
        "value": "Nagad",
        "description": "Verify Nagad is the selected option"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Edge Cases and Alternative Descriptions

#### 1. Error Handling Test
**"Attempt to select 'Invalid Option' from Mobile Banking Type dropdown and verify appropriate error handling"**

#### 2. Reset Test
**"Select 'Nagad' from Mobile Banking Type dropdown, then reset to default 'Select Type' option"**

#### 3. Accessibility Test
**"Navigate to Mobile Banking Type dropdown using keyboard, select Nagad option using Enter key, and verify selection is announced to screen readers"**

### Key Testing Considerations

1. **Value vs Text Selection**: The dropdown has `value="20"` but displays `"Nagad"` - tests should handle both scenarios
2. **Validation**: The dropdown has data validation attributes (`data-val-number`) that should be tested
3. **Default State**: Tests should verify initial state shows "Select Type" as placeholder
4. **Form Integration**: Tests should verify how the selection affects the overall form submission

### Supported Natural Language Patterns

The AI-Powered Web Testing Agent can understand these natural language variations:
