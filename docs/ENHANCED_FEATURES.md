# Enhanced Features - AI-Powered Web Testing Agent

## Overview
This document outlines the enhanced features implemented to better align with the functional requirements specified in the problem statement.

## New Features Implemented

### 1. JSON Format Support for Test Case Upload
- **Feature**: Extended file upload to support JSON format test cases
- **Implementation**: Added JSON parsing in `src/routes/upload.js`
- **Supported Formats**: CSV, Excel (.xlsx, .xls), and JSON
- **JSON Structure**: 
```json
{
  "testCases": [
    {
      "name": "Test Name",
      "description": "Test Description",
      "url": "https://example.com",
      "actions": [
        {
          "type": "navigate|input|click|verify|wait|assert_visible|assert_text",
          "locator": "CSS_selector",
          "value": "input_value",
          "description": "Human readable description"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### 2. Enhanced AI Parsing
- **Feature**: Improved AI parsing to match problem statement requirements
- **Implementation**: Enhanced `src/services/openai.js` with better prompts
- **Supported Action Types**:
  - `navigate`: Navigate to a URL
  - `input`: Fill text into input fields
  - `click`: Click buttons, links, or elements
  - `verify`: Check if redirected to expected URL
  - `wait`: Wait for elements or time
  - `assert_visible`: Assert element is visible
  - `assert_text`: Assert text content
- **Fallback**: Graceful fallback to rule-based parsing when OpenAI API is unavailable

### 3. Parallel Test Execution
- **Feature**: Added support for parallel test execution
- **Implementation**: Enhanced `src/routes/test.js` with parallel execution logic
- **Configuration**: 
  - Toggle between sequential and parallel execution
  - Configurable max concurrency (2-5 concurrent tests)
  - Automatic batching for efficient resource usage
- **Benefits**: Faster test execution for large test suites

### 4. Enhanced Input Validation and Security
- **Feature**: Comprehensive input validation and sanitization
- **Implementation**: Added validation functions in `src/routes/test.js`
- **Security Measures**:
  - XSS protection through input sanitization
  - URL validation and sanitization
  - Action type validation against allowed list
  - String length limits
  - Malicious input detection

### 5. Improved Test Execution Tracking
- **Feature**: Step-by-step execution tracking with detailed results
- **Implementation**: Enhanced `src/services/playwright.js` 
- **Benefits**:
  - Detailed step information with timestamps
  - Individual step success/failure tracking
  - Better error reporting and debugging
  - Enhanced screenshot capture on failures

### 6. Enhanced Action Support and Timeout Handling
- **Feature**: Support for new action types and improved timeout handling
- **Implementation**: Enhanced `src/services/playwright.js` with better error handling
- **New Features**:
  - Configurable timeout per action (default 60 seconds, 90 seconds for text selectors)
  - Retry logic for text-based click actions
  - Alternative selector fallback strategies  
  - Enhanced error messages for better debugging
  - Improved waiting strategies for dynamic content
- **Timeout Improvements**:
  - Extended default timeouts to handle slow-loading elements
  - Automatic retry with different selector strategies
  - Better handling of `text=` selectors with fallbacks
  - Reduced false failures due to timing issues
- **Implementation**: Extended `executeAction` method in Playwright service
- **New Actions**:
  - `navigate`: Direct navigation actions
  - `verify`: URL verification after navigation
  - `assert_visible`: Element visibility assertions
  - `assert_text`: Text content assertions
- **Compatibility**: Maintains backward compatibility with existing action types

### 7. Enhanced Select Action with Smart Fallback
- **Feature**: Intelligent dropdown selection with multiple selection strategies
- **Problem Solved**: Mobile Banking Type "Nagad" selection failures due to value/text mismatch
- **Implementation**: Added `handleSelectAction()` method with fallback logic
- **Selection Strategies**:
  1. **By value** (original): `value: "nagad"` matches `<option value="nagad">`
  2. **By text/label** (new): `value: "Nagad"` matches visible text in option
  3. **Case-insensitive** (fallback): `value: "NAGAD"` matches lowercase values
  4. **Detailed errors**: Shows available options when selection fails
- **Benefits**:
  - Fixes common dropdown selection issues
  - User-friendly - works with visible text values
  - Backward compatible - existing tests continue working
  - Better error messages for debugging
- **Example Usage**:
```json
{
  "type": "select",
  "locator": "#mobile-banking-type",
  "value": "Nagad",
  "description": "Select Nagad from Mobile Banking Type dropdown"
}
```

### API Enhancements

#### Enhanced Test Execution API
```
POST /api/test/execute-all
{
  "browserType": "chromium|firefox|webkit",
  "headless": true|false,
  "parallel": true|false,
  "maxConcurrency": 2-5
}
```
