# Element Type Priority Fix

## Issue Description

The web testing agent was clicking the wrong element when multiple elements contained the same text. Specifically, when both a navbar link and a submit button contained "Log in", the system would click the navbar link instead of the intended submit button, even when `elementType: "button"` was specified.

## Root Cause

The `handleTextBasedClick` method in `src/services/playwright.js` was trying the generic `text=X` selector first, which would match any element containing that text. Playwright would then click the first matching element in DOM order (usually the navbar link), completely ignoring the `elementType` prioritization that was supposed to happen.

## Solution

Modified the `handleTextBasedClick` method to:

1. **When `elementType` is specified**: Skip the generic text selector and immediately use element-type-prioritized selectors
2. **When no `elementType` is specified**: Maintain the original behavior for backward compatibility

## Code Changes

### Before
```javascript
// Try generic text selector first, then fall back to prioritized selectors
await this.page.click(textSelector, { ...options, timeout: 10000 });
```

### After
```javascript
// If elementType is specified, use prioritized selectors immediately
if (options.elementType) {
    const alternatives = this.buildAlternativeSelectors(text, options.elementType);
    // Try prioritized selectors first...
}
// Otherwise, use original retry logic for backward compatibility
```

## Test Cases

The fix is verified by the following test scenarios:

1. **Button Priority**: `{type: "click", selector: "text=Log in", elementType: "button"}` - clicks button elements first
2. **Link Priority**: `{type: "click", selector: "text=Log in", elementType: "link"}` - clicks link elements first  
3. **Default Behavior**: `{type: "click", selector: "text=Log in"}` - maintains button priority by default

## Impact

- ✅ **Solves the Issue**: Elements are now clicked based on their specified type
- ✅ **Backward Compatible**: Existing test cases without `elementType` continue to work
- ✅ **Better Reliability**: Reduces ambiguity in automated tests
- ✅ **Clear Error Messages**: Provides better debugging information when clicks fail

## Testing

Run the test suite to verify the fix:

```bash
# Test parsing functionality
node tests/test-button-click-fix.js

# Test selector prioritization
node tests/test-selector-building.js

# Test the specific fix
node tests/test-element-priority-fix.js

# View demonstration
node tests/demo-element-priority-fix.js
```

For manual testing with browsers (requires `npx playwright install`):
- Use `tests/test-page-element-priority.html` as a test page
- Create test cases with `elementType: "button"` and `elementType: "link"`
- Verify the correct elements are clicked
