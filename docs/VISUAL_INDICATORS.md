# Visual Test Interaction Indicators

## Overview

The AI-Powered Web Testing Agent now includes visual interaction indicators that show green borders around elements during test execution. This feature provides real-time visual feedback when the testing agent interacts with elements on web pages.

## Features

### Visual Indicators
- **Green Border**: Elements being interacted with display a 3px solid green border (#28a745)
- **Glow Effect**: Elements get a green box-shadow for enhanced visibility
- **Action Labels**: Elements show a small label indicating the action being performed (e.g., "🤖 Typing...", "🤖 Clicking...")
- **Temporary Display**: Indicators are shown for 2 seconds by default and then automatically removed

### Supported Actions
The visual indicators are displayed for the following action types:

- **input/fill/type**: Shows "🤖 Typing..." when filling text fields
- **click**: Shows "🤖 Clicking..." when clicking buttons, links, or elements
- **select**: Shows "🤖 Selecting..." when changing dropdown selections
- **check**: Shows "🤖 Checking..." when checking checkboxes
- **uncheck**: Shows "🤖 Unchecking..." when unchecking checkboxes
- **hover**: Shows "🤖 Hovering..." when hovering over elements
- **assert_visible**: Shows "🤖 Checking visibility..." when verifying element visibility
- **assert_text**: Shows "🤖 Checking text..." when verifying element text content

## Implementation Details

### CSS Styles
The visual indicators use the following CSS:

```css
.test-interaction-indicator {
    border: 3px solid #28a745 !important;
    box-shadow: 0 0 10px rgba(40, 167, 69, 0.6) !important;
    transition: border 0.3s ease, box-shadow 0.3s ease !important;
}
.test-interaction-indicator::before {
    content: "🤖 Testing..." !important;
    position: absolute !important;
    top: -25px !important;
    left: 0 !important;
    background: #28a745 !important;
    color: white !important;
    padding: 2px 8px !important;
    font-size: 12px !important;
    border-radius: 3px !important;
    z-index: 10000 !important;
    pointer-events: none !important;
}
```

### Selector Support
The visual indicators work with various selector types:

- **CSS Selectors**: Standard CSS selectors like `#id`, `.class`, `tag`
- **XPath Selectors**: XPath expressions for complex element selection
- **Text-based Selectors**: Playwright's `text=` selectors for finding elements by text content

### Error Handling
- Graceful degradation if visual indicator injection fails
- Warning messages logged for debugging
- No interruption to test execution if indicators fail to display

## Benefits

1. **Real-time Feedback**: See exactly which elements are being interacted with during test execution
2. **Debugging Aid**: Helps identify if the correct elements are being targeted
3. **Test Visualization**: Makes test execution more transparent and easier to follow
4. **Non-intrusive**: Indicators don't interfere with test functionality
5. **Automatic Cleanup**: Indicators are automatically removed after interaction

## Usage

The visual indicators are automatically enabled for all test actions. No additional configuration is required. Simply run your tests as usual and the indicators will appear during element interactions.

## Example

When executing a test with the following actions:
```json
[
  {"type": "input", "selector": "#username", "value": "testuser"},
  {"type": "click", "selector": "#submit-button"},
  {"type": "select", "selector": "#country", "value": "US"}
]
```

You will see:
1. The username field highlighted with a green border and "🤖 Typing..." label
2. The submit button highlighted with a green border and "🤖 Clicking..." label  
3. The country dropdown highlighted with a green border and "🤖 Selecting..." label

Each indicator displays for 2 seconds and then disappears automatically.
