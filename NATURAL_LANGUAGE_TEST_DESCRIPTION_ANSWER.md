# Natural Language Test Description for Mobile Banking Type Dropdown

## Problem Statement Answer

**For the HTML element:**
```html
<select class="form-control valid" data-val="true" data-val-number="The field Mobile Banking Type must be a number." id="MobileBankingType" name="MobileBankingType">
<option value="">Select Type</option>
<option value="20">Nagad</option>
</select>
```

## Natural Language Test Description

### Primary Test Description
**"Select 'Nagad' from the Mobile Banking Type dropdown and verify that the selection shows 'Nagad' as the display text with an underlying value of '20', ensuring the form validates correctly for the numeric requirement."**

### Breakdown of Test Actions

This natural language description encompasses several key testing scenarios:

#### 1. **Selection Action**
"Select 'Nagad' from the Mobile Banking Type dropdown"

This would generate:
```json
{
  "type": "select",
  "locator": "#MobileBankingType",
  "value": "Nagad",
  "description": "Select Nagad from Mobile Banking Type dropdown"
}
```

#### 2. **Value Verification**
"Verify the selected option has value '20'"

This would generate:
```json
{
  "type": "assert_text",
  "locator": "#MobileBankingType",
  "value": "20", 
  "description": "Verify dropdown value is 20"
}
```

#### 3. **Display Text Verification**
"Verify 'Nagad' is displayed as the selected option"

This would generate:
```json
{
  "type": "assert_text",
  "locator": "#MobileBankingType option:selected",
  "value": "Nagad",
  "description": "Verify Nagad is displayed as selected"
}
```

#### 4. **Validation Check**
"Verify the form accepts the numeric value and passes validation"

This would generate:
```json
{
  "type": "assert_visible",
  "locator": "#MobileBankingType.valid",
  "description": "Verify dropdown passes numeric validation"
}
```

## Alternative Natural Language Descriptions

### Basic Variations
- "Choose 'Nagad' from the MobileBankingType dropdown"
- "Select option with value '20' from Mobile Banking Type"
- "Pick 'Nagad' from the dropdown with ID 'MobileBankingType'"

### Context-Aware Descriptions
- "In the payment form, select Nagad as the mobile banking type"
- "Choose Nagad for mobile banking and proceed to payment"
- "Select the Nagad option to enable mobile banking payment"

### Verification-Focused Descriptions
- "Verify that Nagad can be selected from Mobile Banking Type dropdown"
- "Check that selecting Nagad sets the dropdown value to '20'"
- "Confirm the Mobile Banking Type dropdown contains a Nagad option"

### Error and Edge Case Descriptions
- "Reset the Mobile Banking Type dropdown to default 'Select Type'"
- "Attempt to select an invalid option and verify error handling"
- "Test keyboard navigation to select Nagad option"

## Complete Test Workflow Description

**"Navigate to the payment form, locate the Mobile Banking Type dropdown (ID: MobileBankingType), verify it shows 'Select Type' as default, select the 'Nagad' option, confirm the selection displays 'Nagad' with value '20', verify the form validation passes for the numeric requirement (data-val-number), and ensure the selection persists during form interaction."**

This comprehensive description would generate a complete test case with multiple actions covering the full user interaction workflow.

## Key Testing Characteristics

### Element-Specific Considerations
1. **Dual Nature**: Value "20" vs Display "Nagad" - tests must verify both
2. **Validation**: `data-val-number` attribute requires numeric validation testing
3. **Bootstrap Styling**: `form-control valid` classes indicate form framework integration
4. **Limited Options**: Only one selectable option besides default placeholder
5. **Default State**: Empty value with "Select Type" placeholder text

### Testing Scope
- **Functional**: Selection works correctly
- **Validation**: Numeric requirement is enforced  
- **Display**: Correct text shown to user
- **Integration**: Form submission includes correct value
- **Accessibility**: Keyboard and screen reader compatibility
- **State Management**: Selection persists and can be reset
